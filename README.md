# HEVD_Stack_Overflow_Exploit

Working on Windows 10 x64 10.0.19044 Build 19044 with the https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver.

I wanted to try some exploit development work on a modern Windows kernel. May update the SMEP bypass to work with Win 11 in the future. Heavily referenced https://connormcgarr.github.io/x64-Kernel-Shellcode-Revisited-and-SMEP-Bypass/ while making this.
